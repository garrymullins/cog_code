<p class=formlabel><span class=SpellE>ExecReportsUI.java</span> - Execute, Burst and View a Report.</p>

<p class=formtext>The Java <span class=SpellE>The ExecReportsUI</span> sample
program runs or bursts a report and saves the output in the specified format.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
</p>


<p class=formlabel>Dependent Files</p>

<p class=formtext>Associated files are contained under the java sample folder.<br>
Additional files required for running are identified in the CLASSPATH definitions
in the run.bat file.</p>

<p class=formlabel>How To Run The Sample Program</p>

<p class=formtext>Double click on the file <span class=SpellE>run.bat</span>.<br>
<br>
A window will be opened containing:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Report Type dropdown box<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Report selection dropdown box<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Burst the Report checkbox<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Execute Report command button<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- URL text box<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Results Display Pane<br>
Click on the 'Execute Report' button to run the sample program.</p>

<p class=formlabel>Expected Results</p>

<p class=formtext>The report is executed and the results are saved locally, in
the file &quot;/webcontent/samples/cmOut.xxx&quot;
under the installation directory. If Burst the Report checkbox is checked, the report will
be burst to email recipients. To successfully burst the report, IBM Cognos must
be configured to use an email server. The output for the report may then be
checked with an appropriate application for viewing files of the selected
output type. The report is not persisted in the content store.</p>

<p class=formlabel>

<p class=formtext>The IBM Cognos Software Development Kit Developer Guide contains additional
information about the samples. See the chapter titled 'Methods' and the
appendix titled 'Code Samples and Language-Specific Coding Practices'.</p>

<p class=formtext>Please note that the samples are not intended to be treated
as end-user applications. Refer to the sample code for examples of how to use
the API when developing your own applications.</p>
