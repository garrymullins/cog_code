<p class="FormLabel">How To Run The Sample Program</p>

<p class="formText">Double click on the file run.bat.<br><br>
A window will be opened containing:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Report selection dropdown box<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Edit Report command button<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- URL text box<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Output Pane<br>

<br>
Select a list report using the drop down box and click on the 'Edit Report' button to run the sample program.<br>
Use the Report Wizard window for selecting modifications to the report specification.</p>
<p class="formText">Note that the sample works only with list reports, and requires a column for each item in the query.<br>
For example, to modify the report Order Product List, first edit the report in Report Studio to remove Revenue from the query.</p>
<p class="formText">The sample has been coded to work with the Go Data Warehouse (query) package.<br>
For example, select the report Order Product List, and from the Product table, add the Product description column.<br>
If you modify this report, however, please update it in Report Studio to remove the extra column and restore Revenue to the query in case other users are referring to this sample.
Alternatively, you can use Report Studio to create a simple list report in the package to modify.<br>
To work with another package, you may need to edit the Metadata class to select nodes differently.<br>
(Edit both occurrences of "/ResponseRoot/folder/folder/folder/querySubject")</p>
